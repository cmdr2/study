Exercises:
* [ddpm.py](ddpm.py) - Simple non-latent DDPM implementation. Works, and generates butterfly images from the Smithsonian dataset.
* [latent_ddpm.py](latent_ddpm.py) - Simple latent DDPM implementation. Runs, but generates garbage outputs. Something's not right.
* [toy_attention.py](toy_attention.py) - Simple multi-headed self-attention implementation. Runs, but isn't sufficient to give good results. Training saturates at a loss value that's still pretty much garbage.
